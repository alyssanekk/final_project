# Costa Rica
## Projects by: Alyssa Nekritz
### Country: Costa Rica
### Administrative Subdivisions: Alajuelita and Goicoechea

**1.**
Costa Rica has 7 provinces, 84 cantons, and 478 districts. The first administrative subdivision breakdown is represented by the image below.
The darkest region, San Jose, is the most populated region. It's the capital of the country and the provice currently has 1,404,242 residents in a 4,966km^2 area. There's a high density there.

The next image represents the breakdoen of the second administrative subdivision. The words are jumbled near the center of the country, by the capital, and that's where the urban population mostly resides. If you zoom into the picture, you get a clearer image of the cantons, like Ascota right above the San Jose lettering. Cocos Island, the tiny dot on the bottom left of the image is technically part of Costa Rica, so it's included in the image. If it was taken away, the subdivision imagery would be better.

The following is a chart and map demonstrating the densities of the subdivisions clearly. In descending order, the population percentages are shown based on the country's population data. There weren't that many gridcells, so I didn't need to subset an area like others did. The center of the country is the most populated and it gets less dense as you move outward. It has to deal with the topography of the areas. There are a lot of forested areas where the population densities are smaller.

Incorporate the plots you have produced through the course of the semester, but also be sure to provide description, analysis and interpretation of the material as part of a comprehensive narrative.  Do not simply add everything you have produced, but instead strategically select the most relevant plots that support your written description, analysis and interpretation of the state of human development in the administrative subdivisions within your selected LMIC. 

Include in your final project deliverable individual sections that address the following. 


2. Describe the population of your LMIC and selected administrative subdivisions.  Spatially describe the population distribution of your LMIC at the first, second and/or third administrative levels as appropriate.  Provide the results from your analysis of your LMIC's population including validation of the predicted spatial distribution of population values at different scales and your interpretation of relevant model results.  Include histograms, density plots, three-dimensional plots, overlays and other supplemental information as needed.  
3. Provide results from your description of human settlements, roadways and health care facilities.  Include supplemental tables that describe settlements, roadways and health care facilities as well as three-dimensional plots to further support your description, analysis, interpretation and findings.  Analyze and interpret your results in terms of the spatial distribution and size of human settlements, transportation facilities' level-of-service and health care services' accessibility.  Include relevants plots, tables and other supplemental information to support your analysis, interpretation and findings.  Assess the state of human development in the administrative subdivisions within your selected LMIC and state your finding.
